## Emergency Fund First

**Rule #1**: NEVER invest money you might need within 3 years.

### Build Your Safety Net

Before investing a single dollar in stocks:

1. **Calculate your monthly expenses**
   - Rent/mortgage
   - Food
   - Transportation
   - Insurance
   - Utilities
   - Minimum debt payments
   - Phone, internet, subscriptions

2. **Target: 6 months of expenses**
   - Example: If expenses = $5,000/month
   - Emergency fund goal = $30,000
   - Keep in high-yield savings (currently 4-5% APY)

3. **Where to keep it**
   - Marcus by Goldman Sachs
   - Ally Bank
   - Capital One 360
   - Wealthfront Cash Account

**Why this matters**: If you lose your job or have emergency expenses, you won't be forced to sell investments at a loss.

### Your Action Plan

With $5,850/month income:

```
Month 1-6: Build emergency fund ($5,000/month saved)
- Total saved after 6 months: $30,000 ✓
- Now you can START investing safely

Month 7+: Begin investing
- Keep $5,000/month for living expenses
- Invest remaining $850/month
- As income grows, increase investment amount
```

## Risk & Return

**Fundamental truth**: Higher potential returns = Higher risk

### Risk-Return Spectrum

```
LOW RISK, LOW RETURN          →          HIGH RISK, HIGH RETURN
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Savings Account (0-5%)
High-Yield Savings (4-5%)
Treasury Bonds (3-5%)
Corporate Bonds (4-7%)
Dividend Stocks (6-8%)
S&P 500 Index (10% avg)
Growth Stocks (varies widely)
Individual Stocks (???)
Cryptocurrency (extreme volatility)
Options Trading (can lose 100%)
```

### Historical Returns (1926-2024)

- **Large-cap stocks (S&P 500)**: ~10% annually
- **Small-cap stocks**: ~12% annually (but more volatile)
- **Corporate bonds**: ~6% annually
- **Treasury bonds**: ~5% annually
- **Cash/savings**: ~3% annually

**Important**: These are AVERAGES. Any single year can be +30% or -30%.

### Risk Tolerance Assessment

**Conservative** (Your money is for near-term goals)
- Mostly bonds and dividend stocks
- Can handle 10% portfolio drops
- Prioritizes preservation over growth

**Moderate** (10+ year timeline)
- Balanced mix: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- Can handle 20% portfolio drops
- Seeks steady growth with some protection

**Aggressive** (20+ year timeline)
- Mostly stocks: 90%+ equities
- Can handle 40% portfolio drops
- Maximizes long-term growth potential

**Your recommended starting point**: Moderate (you're young with long timeline)

## Asset Classes

### 1. Stocks (Equities)

**What they are**: Ownership shares in companies

**How you make money**:
- Price appreciation (buy low, sell high)
- Dividends (company shares profits)

**Types**:

```
LARGE-CAP STOCKS (Market cap > $10B)
Examples: Apple, Microsoft, Google
Characteristics: More stable, slower growth, dividends
Risk level: Moderate

MID-CAP STOCKS ($2B - $10B)
Examples: Regional banks, established tech
Characteristics: Balance of growth and stability
Risk level: Moderate-High

SMALL-CAP STOCKS (< $2B)
Examples: Emerging companies
Characteristics: High growth potential, volatile
Risk level: High

GROWTH STOCKS
Examples: Tech companies, biotech
Characteristics: Rapid revenue growth, no dividends
Risk level: High

VALUE STOCKS
Examples: Banks, utilities, manufacturers
Characteristics: Undervalued, steady dividends
Risk level: Low-Moderate
```

### 2. Bonds (Fixed Income)

**What they are**: Loans you give to companies/governments

**How you make money**:
- Interest payments (coupon)
- Price appreciation (if interest rates fall)

**Types**:
- **Treasury Bonds**: US government debt (safest)
- **Corporate Bonds**: Company debt (higher yield)
- **Municipal Bonds**: State/city debt (tax-free)
- **High-Yield (Junk) Bonds**: Risky company debt

**Bond math**:
- When interest rates ↑, bond prices ↓
- When interest rates ↓, bond prices ↑

### 3. ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)

**What they are**: Baskets of stocks/bonds that trade like stocks

**Advantages**:
- Instant diversification
- Low fees (0.03% - 0.20% per year)
- Trade anytime during market hours

**Popular ETFs**:

```
BROAD MARKET
VTI - Total US Stock Market (3,700+ stocks)
VXUS - Total International Stocks
VT - Total World Stock Market

S&P 500
SPY, VOO, IVV - All track S&P 500

BONDS
BND - Total US Bond Market
AGG - US Aggregate Bonds

SECTORS
XLK - Technology
XLF - Financials
XLV - Healthcare
XLE - Energy
```

**ETFs vs Individual Stocks**:
- ETF: Less risk, average returns, set-it-and-forget-it
- Stocks: More risk, potential for higher returns, requires research

## Compound Interest

**Einstein**: "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world."

### The Math

```
Simple Interest (no compounding):
$10,000 × 10% = $1,000 per year
After 30 years: $10,000 + ($1,000 × 30) = $40,000

Compound Interest (reinvest gains):
Year 1: $10,000 × 1.10 = $11,000
Year 2: $11,000 × 1.10 = $12,100
Year 3: $12,100 × 1.10 = $13,310
...
After 30 years: $174,494

Difference: $134,494 extra from compounding!
```

### Real-World Example: Your Investment Journey

**Scenario**: Invest $850/month for 30 years at 10% average return

```
Year 5:   $65,000 invested  →  $75,000 value
Year 10:  $102,000 invested →  $175,000 value
Year 15:  $153,000 invested →  $340,000 value
Year 20:  $204,000 invested →  $650,000 value
Year 30:  $306,000 invested →  $1,900,000 value
```

**The magic**: You invested $306K, but earned $1.6M from compounding!

### Time is Your Biggest Asset

**Starting at age 25 vs 35**:

```
Start at 25: Invest $500/month for 40 years
Total invested: $240,000
Value at 65: $3,160,000

Start at 35: Invest $500/month for 30 years
Total invested: $180,000
Value at 65: $1,130,000

Waiting 10 years cost: $2,030,000 lost!
```

**Key lesson**: Start NOW, even with small amounts.

## Diversification

**Old wisdom**: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"

### Why Diversify?

**Single stock risk**:
- Company goes bankrupt → Lose 100%
- Examples: Enron, Lehman Brothers, Blockbuster

**Diversified portfolio**:
- One stock fails → Lose 1-5% of portfolio
- Other stocks compensate
- Smoother returns over time

### Dimensions of Diversification

1. **Number of stocks**
   - 1 stock: Maximum risk
   - 10 stocks: Moderate diversification
   - 30+ stocks: Well-diversified
   - 500+ stocks (S&P 500): Excellent diversification

2. **Sectors**
   - Don't own only tech stocks
   - Spread across: Tech, Healthcare, Finance, Consumer, Energy

3. **Geography**
   - US stocks: 60% of world market
   - International: 40% of world market
   - Diversify globally

4. **Asset classes**
   - Stocks + Bonds
   - Real Estate (REITs)
   - Commodities (gold, etc.)

5. **Time** (dollar-cost averaging)
   - Don't invest everything at once
   - Spread purchases over time

### Sample Diversified Portfolio

```
CONSERVATIVE (Age 50+)
40% US Stocks (VTI)
20% International Stocks (VXUS)
35% Bonds (BND)
5% Cash

MODERATE (Age 30-50)
50% US Stocks (VTI)
25% International Stocks (VXUS)
20% Bonds (BND)
5% Cash

AGGRESSIVE (Age 20-30)  ← Recommended for you
60% US Stocks (VTI)
30% International Stocks (VXUS)
10% Bonds (BND)
0% Cash
```

---

## Dollar-Cost Averaging

**Strategy**: Invest a fixed amount on a regular schedule, regardless of price.

### Example

Invest $1,000/month in VTI for 6 months:

```
Month 1: VTI at $200/share → Buy 5 shares
Month 2: VTI at $180/share → Buy 5.56 shares (price dropped!)
Month 3: VTI at $220/share → Buy 4.55 shares
Month 4: VTI at $190/share → Buy 5.26 shares
Month 5: VTI at $210/share → Buy 4.76 shares
Month 6: VTI at $230/share → Buy 4.35 shares

Total invested: $6,000
Total shares: 29.48
Average price per share: $203.53

If you invested all $6,000 in Month 1:
Price: $200/share → 30 shares
Average: $200/share

Dollar-cost averaging result: Similar outcome, but less stress!
```

### Benefits

1. **Removes emotion**: No trying to "time the market"
2. **Buys more when cheap**: Automatically buy dips
3. **Reduces regret**: Didn't blow all money at market peak
4. **Easier to start**: Don't need lump sum

### Your DCA Plan

```
After emergency fund is built:

Monthly investment: $850
Auto-invest on: 1st of every month
Allocations:
  - 40% VTI ($340)
  - 30% VXUS ($255)
  - 20% Individual stocks ($170)
  - 10% Experimental ($85)

Set it and forget it!
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. ❌ Investing Without Emergency Fund

**Mistake**: Put all savings in stocks, then lose job
**Consequence**: Forced to sell at loss during market downturn
**Solution**: Emergency fund FIRST, then invest

### 2. ❌ Trying to Time the Market

**Mistake**: "Market is high, I'll wait for a crash to buy"
**Reality**: Market often keeps going up, you miss gains
**Data**: Missing the 10 best days over 30 years reduces returns by 50%
**Solution**: Time IN the market > Timing the market

### 3. ❌ Chasing Hot Stocks

**Mistake**: "Everyone's buying this, I need to get in!"
**Reality**: By the time you hear about it, it's often overpriced
**Solution**: Stick to your strategy, buy fundamentally strong companies

### 4. ❌ Panic Selling

**Mistake**: Market drops 20%, sell everything
**Reality**: Missing the recovery, locking in losses
**Example**: 2020 COVID crash
  - March: Market down -35%
  - Many panicked and sold
  - By August: Market recovered fully
  - End of 2021: Market up +60% from bottom
**Solution**: Stay invested, buy MORE during dips

### 5. ❌ Ignoring Fees

**Mistake**: "1% fee doesn't sound like much"
**Reality**: Fees compound against you

```
$100,000 invested for 30 years at 10% return:

0.05% fee (Vanguard ETF):
Final value: $1,622,000

1.00% fee (actively managed fund):
Final value: $1,317,000

Difference: $305,000 lost to fees!
```

**Solution**: Use low-cost index funds (< 0.20% fees)

### 6. ❌ Not Diversifying

**Mistake**: "I love Apple, 100% of my portfolio is AAPL"
**Reality**: Even great companies can stumble
**Solution**: Max 5% in any single stock

### 7. ❌ Overtrading

**Mistake**: Buy and sell constantly, trying to catch every move
**Reality**:
  - Transaction fees add up
  - Short-term capital gains taxes (up to 37%)
  - Emotional exhaustion
**Data**: The best investors? Often dead or forgot they had accounts
**Solution**: Buy quality, hold long-term

### 8. ❌ Following "Hot Tips"

**Mistake**: "My friend/coworker/online guru says this stock will 10x!"
**Reality**:
  - They usually don't
  - If it sounds too good to be true, it is
  - You're the last to know
**Solution**: Do your own research, ignore hype
